Calculate familiarity

= Area Responsibility + History Frequently Delivery + Compactness of Area of Actual Delivery Shipment

Area Responsibility
= 1 if the area is in the Responsibility
= 0.5 if the area is not in the Responsibility but connected to the area is in the Responsibility
= 0 if the area is not in the Responsibility and not connected to the area is in the Responsibility


History Frequently Delivery
= The summation of (The number of shipments of the area / The number of shipments of the most visit area)


Compactness of Area of Actual Delivery Shipment
= 1 - (Area of Actual Delivery Shipment / Area of All Shipment)
